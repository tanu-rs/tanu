//! # Tanu Core
//!
//! Core functionality for the tanu WebAPI testing framework.
//!
//! This crate provides the fundamental building blocks for tanu, including:
//! - Test runners and execution logic
//! - HTTP client functionality  
//! - Assertion macros and utilities
//! - Configuration management
//! - Test reporting infrastructure
//!
//! Most users should use the main `tanu` crate rather than importing `tanu-core` directly.

/// Test names identify specific test functions within a module.
